Say goodbye to a tangerine sky say hello say hello to tomorrow- when you say goodbye
to a tangerine sky you lose your pain lose your fear lose your sorrow

what if you were livin yours instead of hatin mine findin truth and spreadin love and searchin
deep inside – see me glidin swiftly to that place I need to be that home grown irie zone
harvesting my seeds

I’m gonna live my life from day to night with no hesitation
Make the best of every situation that I find myself placed in
Decidin right from wrong, choosing my final destination
Cause when it’s said and done, it’s just yourself that you are facin’

Say goodbye to a tangerine sky say hello say hello to tomorrow- when you say goodbye to a
tangerine sky you lose your pain lose your fear lose your sorrow

Say Say 
Say good-bye to tomorrow
Wash your sorrow
Live and learn
Listen up and follow
Do what you want, so let me rock it
I be dammed if you think you gonna stop it
Popo it drop it D-Loc get up on it
Don’t you think your sink cause you can’t call it 
I be the one that balled you up in college
Killa cross just brake you down Kottonmouth Kings on the radio now
Make you think when you see my face D-Loc with style and grace

I wanna touch the sky unleash control wanna feel time travel real thru my soul wanna ride real
high wanna lay real low independent free thought control my zone my zones full blown like a
plant full grown transform myself thru this microphone – Hold up ….change that tone Johnny
Richter come thru with your barritone

It’s time to open up your eyes and catch sight
Cause you could wake up in the morning, and not make it to the night
Take advantage of your life, you only get one try
You gonna be satisfied today if tonight you died?
Well I’m not that guy, I keep my blood runnin’
You say you’ve had enough, and I say keep it comin
Now you’re bummed because you’re done and you’re left all alone
Should’ve known livin blown you’d end up like a clone WHAATTTT!

Say goodbye to a tangerine sky say hello say hello to tomorrow- when you say goodbye to a

It’s not a place on any map it’s Kaya meditation that home grown herbal zone peaceful
medication at peace no understandin no condition but love at peace all accepting to the sky above

Say goodbye to a tangerine sky say hello say hello to tomorrow- when you say goodbye to a
