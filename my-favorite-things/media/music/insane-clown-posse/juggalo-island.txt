You know what would be the shit? (Let's trip in the sun baby)
What if... we had our own island, man? (Let's trip in the sun baby)

I got my toes in the sand, watching hoes play volleyball
It's summertime and I'm feeling jolly y'all
Food on the fire, boats in the water and
Taking time off from my serial slaughtering
Here for the weekend, me and these friends
Sunny sunshine, blue skies never end
There's a mermaid waving me to come in
Underwater on my balls she's humming
Smoking on a fat one, we come to have fun
I got my dick in your hotdog bun
Pouring off shots for everybody that's sipping
Let's get loose now, skinny dipping
Don't hate me cuz the Speedo I'm wearing
Got your girlfriend staring, we out here
Skies so clear, ice cold beer
Suntan topless, bitch, come over here

On Juggalo Island
We can be one
Haha ha haha!
Let our nuts hang by the water
On Juggalo Island
We can have fun
Haha ha haha!
We can let go by the water

Bang! Pow! Boom! Sunny like high noon
Met some Lettes and they all coming over soon
Have a luau, I'm getting blew out
Come over here if you ever get flew out
We got a place for ya, never will ignore ya
Got a hot plate, and a drink we gonna pour ya
Corps on the grill, Clays on the 1,2
And around here, the dead have fun too
Stiffs in the water, floating, we see you
Doing flips in the air, run and see, dude
No cops, unless they pouring off shots
Unless ya helping us smoke these crops
Surfing on the big one, having big fun
Fucking with a big fat one under the sun
Letting em hang, doing our thing
Listen to em up and down the beach, everybody sing

On Juggalo Island
We can be one
Haha ha haha!
Let our nuts hang by the water
On Juggalo Island
We can have fun
Haha ha haha!
We can let go by the water

And when the sun goes down, we up all night
Dance of the dead, boogie-woogie in the moonlight
Fuck the rules, right? The dead do bite
Listen to the Ouija board, we can only do right
Can't do wrong, fatty in a blue thong
Everybody can't be together with you gone
Come get with this, we get ridiculous
This world is ours, every bit of this

Get you a burger with cheese. Enjoy the breeze
I'm jumping coconuts outta palm trees
And we all in. I'm freeballing
See me shore-side, surfing on a dolphin
Grass skirts, dead hula girls, hatchets
And whatever your fishing hook catches
We only without you, so let's hang
Boom! Pow! Bang! Let's do the damn thing!

On Juggalo Island
We can be one
Haha ha haha!
Let our nuts hang by the water
On Juggalo Island
We can have fun
Haha ha haha!
We can let go by the water

[Keep repeating "Let's trip in the sun, baby]
On Juggalo Island
Haha ha haha!
On Juggalo Island
Haha ha haha!

On Juggalo Island
We can be one
Haha ha haha!
Let our nuts hang by the water
On Juggalo Island
We can have fun
Haha ha haha!
We can let go by the water
